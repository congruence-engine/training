### CE_training Round 2 (spring 2023) - Version Control, Linked Open Data and Machine Learning

## Intro to Git-GitHub, 20 April 2023, MakerSpace, SAS
This is an introductory lesson using the Library Carpentry course (https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-git/) to begin to understand and use Git/GitHub. In this lesson we use Git from the Unix Shell (it would be handy if you had attended the lesson from the first round of training). You will learn the Git repositoriesâ€™ structure, how to link a local Git repository to GitHub, how to move changes between a local Git repository and a GitHub repository and the use GitHub Pages to collaborate and publish your work. We are also going to use the Software Carpentry course (https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) to learn about version control in collaborative projects.

Instructor : Dr Anna-Maria Sichani, co-facilitator : Kaspar Beelen

## Machine Learning I - Principles for GLAM , 3 May 2023, MakerSpace, SAS
This lesson will use the Library Carpentry lesson (https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/machine-learning-librarians-archivists/) in order to provide the foundation to machine learning-based research and projects with heritage collections. More precisely, learners will be able to understand key terms and concepts associated with AI and Machine Learning in Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM), familiarise themselves with practical, technical steps involved in undertaking machine learning projects as well as reflect on ethical implications of applying machine learning to cultural heritage collections and discuss potential mitigation strategies.

Instructors : Dr Anna-Maria Sichani, Mark Bell (TNA)



## Linked Open Data & Wikidata
This training will have two parts: 1)in the first part , through this Programming Historian lesson (https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-linked-data) you will be introduced to the core concepts of Linked Open Data, including URIs, ontologies, RDF formats, and a gentle intro to the graph query language SPARQL. 2)For the second part, we are going to use the Library Carpentry lesson on Wikidata  (https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-wikidata/) and you will learn the underlying concepts of Wikidata and how to work with them. At the conclusion of the lesson you will: know what the Wikidata interface looks like; know how Wikidata is linked to other Wiki projects; create and develop Wikidata items yourself; add references to Wikidata; create a search query in Wikidata using the query language SPARQL; understand how to perform a mass import into Wikidata.
