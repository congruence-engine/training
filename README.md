### Round 1 (autumn 2022)

 ## Data cleaning and structuring

Regular Expressions - 2nd November, 9-13pm, instructor:  Kunika Kono 
Regular expressions (often shortened to 'regex') are a sophisticated pattern matching syntax system that can boost your ability to manipulate text in bulk. Regular expressions are useful in a wide range of text and data processing tasks, such as find and replace, formatting, transforming and extracting values, and are supported by many software including Microsoft Word and OpenRefine. As part of the Congruence Engine Data Cleaning training, this session hopes to introduce regular expressions with a guided Library Carpentry lesson (https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-data-intro/). By the end of the session, the participants should have a good understanding of what regular expressions are, be familiar with the basic syntax, and have had some practice reading, writing and using regular expression patterns.
 
The main part (9:00-12:00) of the session will be a guided lesson based on the Library Carpentry’s Introduction to Working with Data (Regular Expressions), and in the last part (12:00-13:00), we will look at practical applications of regular expressions, and some common use cases and techniques.
 
The session assumes no prior knowledge of regular expressions, and there are no prerequisite readings.
 
You will need to have:
- A computer or tablet device, with a camera and microphone
- Internet connection
- Web browser
 
There will be hands-on group exercises and you may find having a large screen or an additional screen or device useful, to be able to see both the Zoom and web browser windows at the same time, but this is not a requirement.

## OpenRefine - 9th November , 9-13pm , instructor:  Rhiannon Lewis 

 
OpenRefine is a free and powerful software for cleaning and transforming data. As part of the Congruence Engine Data Cleaning training, this session hopes to introduce OpenRefine with a guided Library Carpentry lesson. OpenRefine works best with data in tabular form, and is a great tool for cleaning, transforming, exploring and reconciling data. It allows for users to get an overview of their datasets, as well as giving the possibility to extend data with web services and external data sources. This introductory course will cover functionalities like faceting, filtering, clustering, transformations, looking up and exporting data. All useful tools for data wrangling! The goal of the training is a first introduction to OpenRefine, participants should have a basic working knowledge of the software at the end.
 
The session will now be held fully online, not in person as originally advertised.
 
You will need to have:
- A computer or tablet device, with a camera and microphone
- Internet connection
- Web browser (please use: Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Chrome or Safari.)
- OpenRefine installed 
 
The session assumes no prior knowledge of OpenRefine, and there are no prerequisite readings. However, you will need to have OpenRefine already installed on your machine before the session. Library Carpentry has instructions on how to do this and further resources here: https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-open-refine/setup.html (If you are running OpenRefine on a Mac please see "Note for Mac users" at the bottom of the page here for further advice on how to open it.)  
 

## Command Line session : 23rd November, 9-13pm, instructor:  Anna-Maria Sichani 


The command line is a quick, powerful, text-based interface that allows you to effectively and efficiently interact with your computer to accomplish a huge set of tasks. As part of the Congruence Engine Data Cleaning training, this session hopes to introducethis session hopes to introduce the “Unix shell” which is the definitive example of a “command line interface” (for the Unix operating system and for Unix-like systems), with a guided Library Carpentry lesson. This lesson will cover a small number of basic commands. By the end of the course you will able to explain why and how to use the command line; able to navigate through your file system and find directories and files; open them, perform basic data manipulation tasks such as combining and copying files, as well as both reading them and making relatively simple edits like counting. These commands constitute the building blocks upon which more complex commands can be constructed to fit your research data or project.

The session will now be held fully online, not in person as originally advertised.

The main part of the session will be a guided lesson based on the Library Carpentry’s The Unix Shell, and in the last part (12:00-13:00), we will look at practical applications of regular expressions, and some common use cases and techniques.
 
You will need to have:
- A computer or tablet device, with a camera and microphone
- Internet connection
- Web browser
 
There will be hands-on group exercises and you may find having a large screen or an additional screen or device useful, to be able to see both the Zoom and web browser windows at the same time, but this is not a requirement.
 
The session assumes no prior knowledge of Command line and there are no prerequisite readings.
To complete this session, you will need a UNIX-like shell environment -see Setup. You will also need to download the file shell-lesson.zip from GitHub to your desktop and extract it there (once you have unzipped/extracted the file, you should end up with a folder called “shell-lesson”).
