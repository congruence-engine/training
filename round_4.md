##  Video subtitling and description with Large Language Model assistance - mutual learning session, 26th March 2024, 11-2pm , MakerSpace, SAS

Summary: This session will outline an experimental project undertaken at BT Group Archives over the last year. BT has on ongoing programme to digitise and make publicly available historic corporate films held on vulnerable videotape formats. We first experimented with using OpenAI's voice-recognition and transcription tool Whisper to produce subtitles, with very successful results. We then used Large Language Models to try produce summaries of the films, based on the subtitles, that might be suitable for archival descriptions. The session will explain what was done, the challenges encountered, and the results.
