## Can ChatGPT do it? - CE_Mutual Learning session, 6th December 2023, 9-1pm , MakerSpace, SA

Summary: In the spirit of shifting to a mutual learning approach, this training invites people to share their experiences of how they have been using ChatGPT. The session's aim is inspire each other for potential applications of the tool. Newcomers who have been hesitant to use ChatGPT are more than encouraged to join, as we will provide a welcoming environment for experimenting with the tool and talking through any concerns (ethical, practical and/or other) you might have. After a showcase of examples, we are hoping to live-test suggestions by participants and reflect upon the results (and practices). So bring along any ideas you have, no matter if you are a ChatGPT veteran or a first-time user!
