# Training

Since the early stages of the project, a working group on Training and Mutual Learning has been initiated and co-led by Jane Winters and Anna-Maria Sichani ans supported by Kunika Kono aiming to orchestrate better the training provision of the project, also through a dedicated basecamp page (23 Participants). Alongside the development of a dedicated training program aiming to cover the emergent digital needs of the wider project team, the working group has been also active in promoting and communicating training opportunities from other stakeholders among the CE project team.



The training, as of 2023, has been structured as follows:

- the top-level programme (as masterclasses) developed in response to the general teamâ€™s digital needs


- fortnightly drop-in sessions on Monday afternoons with Kunika Kono to discuss digital and technical questions and issues related to our work on the Congruence Engine.

  
- Interim and customised training needs that might bubble up from the new investigation meetings.
